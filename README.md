## Project Structures
**ER_Diagram.pdf** contains our ER diagram for our database tables.

**project.sql** contains SQL commands to setup the database.

## Prerequisites
- `Python3`
- `MySQL8.0`
- `mysql-connector`
- `pandas`

## Installation
Run the following command to install all the dependencies.
```pip3 install pandas mysql-connector-python```

## Getting Started
After installing all the dependencies, we can now start our education application.
